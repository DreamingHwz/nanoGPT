 on a clipper ship
lifted out of the water by the powerful wind-breath
of my two distant coastal families; my warring
mother and “blood” father, her lovely
companionable family in Los Angeles and Manhattan;
his friendly, compliant relations in Manhattan and Bensonhurst...
I dreamt both families were jammed on the deck
of the ship, waving, gesticulating, shouting,
and that I clung to a raft’s rope as a great
wave flung me back and back, but the truth
was I wasn’t sure I wanted to be near.
I wanted to fly apart—in the nowhere—.
When our two-door Chrysler Windsor
edged off the gravel onto the highway
I thrust my head right where the plush fabric
of the front seat parted like the Red Sea,
and said to my new dad. “You know what.
I love Warren more than I love you.”
“You don’t know what you’re saying,” he snapped.
“He’s just a little putz, and I can get
rid of him with a snap
of my fingers. Presto. See. Now—where is he?”
The seat beside me was empty. I was empty.
And my heart pounded in wild longing for its fullness lost.
I should have kept my mouth shut
but I thought my heart would burst
with that secret locked in it: why doesn’t he
understand? It wasn’t that I loved him less than I had
but that I loved Warren more. He had the same reaction
several years later, in Chicago, when I announced
my love for Carol, a round-faced, soft spoken blond girl
I’d brought home to play with my electric trains and drink
hot chocolate one brutal winter afternoon. I loved her and
I kissed her in the elevator on the way up.
I wanted him to say: I’m so happy for you,let’s put on some 45’s and dance.
He said, “You don't know what love is.”
And for the first time slapped me in the face.
I wrote my “blood” father of my love and he wrote back
he was glad I was “making friends out there.”
Why didn’t these men understand, I know what words mean,
by love I meant love, however transitory.
One word, two fathers, two red stone faces,
unblinking, dismayed.


title: from Rider: [8. Dropouts]
poem: Dropouts

Mace had the kind of courage you could easily mistake
for brawn. I don’t know why I call it courage.

Sure, he stood up to greasers. And didn’t visibly fret
on the days when his report card made hard fact

of what was already apparent from his absences.
Yet Mace was gifted with an uninflected quickness, a fine

intelligence of his own despair, a knowledge—
as he gunned the engine of his once white ’58 Chevy,

with a four-on-the-floor he’d installed himself,
to climb higher into the hills above the city—

of where nowhere was...
Light shadow cutting brusquely across the canyons—

                                                             *
Like everyone else in our class, Mace was a year
older than me. He had stubble on his chin.

I dragged a razor up and down my cheeks
to inspire fast, early growth.

“Don’t shave your jowls,” friends warned,
knowing I overdid everything,

“or you’ll grow hair there later.”Later was a word I disdained, its insistence

on the future tense, postponement—
life on the back burner.

                                                              *

Mace seemed incapable of worry.
His coolness and insouciance made girls stare.

He was always brushing back the shock of raven-
black hair that fell over his right eyebrow.

The same teacher who sent me lickety split
to the principal’s office

would lean over Mace’s desk and whisper
warmly, compassionately in his ear.

They would nod together. I could fill in every blank.
“What’s the matter Richard?”

“Nothing.” “If you’re having trouble,”
this is where the whispering grew most intense,

“I want you to feel you can talk to me as a friend.
Your work in class is so good, you have so much ability,
       Richard...”

Mace would never protest, never defend himself.
Indignation was a country where he’d never been.

“You may hate me,” I thought, praying she would not
double the insult of the absence of her concern

for me with a glance in my direction,
“but deep down Mace and I are the same.”

                                                             *

Mace and I were running into the same problem
at the same time. Mathematical

wizards that we were we couldn’t solve
advanced algebraic equations in our head;

we were vexed by an added integer.
We had gotten this far without lifting a pencil.

History was being sold to us as a dead language
of fixed events and we wouldn’t buy.

What is a fact, I wondered, and I could see
the same question wrinkling Mace’s brow.

                                                              *

Mace’s problems weren’t academic. His disgust thrummed
like telephone wires in the wind, even his saturnine

presence was deceptive, like his beat-up Chevy
with its secret store of power concealed under the hood.

Mace too began the year in the front row,
placed there on the strength of pure ability.

He sank slowly, buoyed as I was, by the one
assigned book we read, Great Expectations.

Mace attended to his tasks in the classroom.
I dreamt of escape via the window’s easy access.

There were unknown roads to be driven, gulleys
to be plumbed; girls: a world of lovely distractions.

                                                             *
For all the years I lived in Salt Lake City
I can’t remember seeing a single bird.

I felt watched in Salt Lake City ever since
that first day when the old geezer stepped

out of the shadows, on a street vast and empty
and without verticals, to reprimand my Double-
 mint gum wrapper for lighting in the gutter.
But only around the time of Hitchcock’s The Birds

did I start to withdraw from sight.
I was keen to see The Birds the Wednesday

afternoon it opened and I wanted the other—“good”—“Mark R.,”
the irreproachable blond Mormon angel everyone loved, to join us.

Our growling engine brought his mother to the porch.
The sun glared on her helmet of curlers.

Mark had “homework and chores,” she said, he “can’t come down.”
But he had already descended. And stood framed in the doorway.

I couldn’t get accustomed to the light
in the trampled meadows around his house,

the glow of dandelions, thistles, weeds.
Mark’s red cheeks reeked of aspiration and I could read

his thoughts: why couldn’t I wait until night?Why was I dragging myself down?
 Why skip history and rifle assembly?The movie would wait.

But I would not. I was keen,
and, seeking a purging terror to cleanse

me of my dread, I sat alone with Mace
in the vast empty theater alive to each

click and flicker in the projection room,
and the radiant impalpable dust

caught in the unstinting beam;
released from the limits of our world

until the screeching stopped
and, looked at askance by strangers,

we stepped into an iron dark
which held no trace of the light we’d left.

                                                              *
I forked over whatever change I had
to fuel each day’s free-wheeling splendor.

One morning, knowing Mace was down to smoking butts,
I brought a pack of my mother’s Kents

as an offering. Mace scorned them.
He only smoked Marlboros.

Yet later, desperate and broke in the maze
of roads through the hills overlooking the city,

he broke off the filters and smoked in silence.
I was used to doing the talking

for the two of us but this was different.
He pulled up besides a long driveway.

A vaulted roof jutted above columns of tall firs.
This was where he lived. He’d be

“a sec”—he had “some smokes” stashed in a drawer.
I followed him past the plaster jockey and the massy trees

toward an opulent, utterly contemporary house,
fronted by oak door and gold bell-knocker,

angular, white, high-ceilinged, skylit...
Our apartment could have fit into the living room...

Now I understood: Mace lived in the clouds.
Though I couldn’t see beyond the back yard

through the landscaping I knew what the view
must be like: that was the reason to live there;

for the nights, when the city, innocent as it was,
still blazed through its grid of interlocking lights.
                                                               *

On May Day, Mace and I, long ago tossed
out of R.O.T.C. for “insubordination,”

but required to attend the final show-of-arms
sat together in the bleachers,

in splendid isolation, and watched
as the rule-followers—led

by the many-striped, other Mark R.—
in their woolen khaki uniforms,

shouldering their M 1 rifles,
dropped like flies in the insuperable heat.


title: On Reflection
poem: because a box is a box: humans are cultivated
into said box without choice or clarification, specimens
only existing—as in: (you—i—us). flesh & frame—
restricted bone matter comprising a box reluctant
not to be a box. but nurtured inside the box, let’s say
form which is shaped by & indigenous, to, the box &
the creator of the holy box—only leading to another
question about, of course, the infamous box—form
turns deceitful inside the box like any [thing] caged,
leaning to a non-empathetic approach steeped in revolt
—is judas in waiting. note: the box is not universal
nor the universal. whatever hopes of otherworldliness
lies in the box itself. the box will not elongate, dissolve
or vanish without reaction to an action & here within
lies problem of perspective as in—there is none—zero.
along time’s continuum, color, too, is encouraged
for the sake of the construction of the box, which
is precious as flickering light, but cannot be verified since
darkness is the original concept of all things human.


title: Dear Margaret Cho [korea might be gay but I do not think you are.]
poem: korea might be gay but I do not think you are.
korea is a peninsula. you and I are people meaning that
we have hair we comb and things to look at. our lips
pout and take on the fullness of an adopted meaning.
the fact of the matter is that relentlessness is a hand-
shake, a limp fish or glass of lukewarm tea. the fact of
the matter is that standing on a stage everything is
comic, meaning small and memorable, of the insubstan-
tial "universe," a minor disaster or floating chord.
the darkness is outside when I see you, not in.
I laugh when the funny thing gets said, and mostly I
laugh inside. on the inside is without curves and artifi-
cial spaces, many of them not gay or korea. but when I
see you they all run and speech is maybe stammer,
sometimes slur.
margaret cho, your tongue might wreak more havoc
than in speaks, outside being from the vantage point of
escalating stairs, from dark glasses and escapades. the
vantage being from a great height, a lighter space on
the inside that was formerly before the dark and laugh.
we really wait for the funny things before they are said
and let go for ever after.
margaret, there are many funny sisters and there are
many porn stores. I too think woo lae ok is really petri-
fied of its own fish. that there are babies and there are
dykes, that this little piggy has something, that a pubic
mound transforms into a public space, not being gay or
with outstanding curves, prayerful and abashed, facing
the tide, grown over, rediscovered in the woods by
strangers and haunted for years and years.


title: Daniel Dae Kim
poem: a perfect symmetry
of both parts animal, feline and quizzical, and man,
              made
(undone) sworn in stormed again
electric, transmitted from the foreground into
               appropriate weather
the skin being elastic cause for several considerations
contrite ((argued over)
aren't we of beautiful tangents
beautiful ox blood, black sand
morning from small wire filigree, a gesture


title: Dear Margaret Cho [we aren't differentiable with bangs and hooded lids.]
poem: we aren't differentiable with bangs and hooded lids.
I know the likeness doesn't stop right there.
what's so great about being horny? the joke is insatiable.
it rips and roars between and through.
we both have found our mother's jewels.
buried in closets, rolled in silk thread and bunting.
done in scarlet, fortunately found, never for the men
            in sharing.
these are our secrets. our punch lines and couplets.
I went to bed thinking "pixies." the bliss and after-
             math of a spiritual kiss.
how you resonate without rooms, maintaining perfect
             valences.
where is the disaster at the end of this dread?
in my dream state you were queen, a reigning
            bodhisattva without a sprig.
I climbed inside your belly. punched inside you
            laughed and laughed,
converting persimmons into a freedom jelly.
Slathered all over, I found us exuberant,
happy to swing or go both ways.


title: from Rider [II]
poem: And yesterday something shattering happened.
Not yesterday, but several (that’s becoming
a favorite word) weeks ago I came across
Kitaj’s The Jewish Rider and wept:
there he was in the very image of my stepfather;
the pate where a few strands of hair still frolic,
the same skinny legs, the same misguided
attempt to dress in a sporty way (who’s
watching?), the same abstractedness,
the same shlumpy—boneless—posture, gazing not
at the landscape flashing past
with wires lashed to the treetops as if with one
tug the countryside would vanish,
or listening to the tick of the rails,
but fixed—distractedly—on his lower extremities,
white loafers and the crease in his pants and nylon
socks to see whether or not he should roll them up ... ;
no: looking both beyond and through physical space
into an inner dark. Why else draw the eyes as shadows?
It’s his glimpse into another world.

                                                                *

My mother’s father hunted and rode.
        My father rode and fished.
My stepfather never budged
        from his Barca Lounger
once the amber liquid began to pour. He had a spiritual life
and a social life and no
        physical life. But he liked it
that I was always outside:
        maybe that’s why he never
got on my back about grades;
        he might have thought
that this boy has to be outside
        at this time in his life.
Maybe it’s more important
        that he roam the canyons and the hills
that he know the streets
        that he come home
covered with leaves and bark and mud,
        than that he sit there
like a good young scholar
        like I was, a Rabbi
at twenty giving money home
        to my parents in their cabbagy tenement
in the Bronx. This is a boy
        who needs space. One time—
I think I had my learner's permit—
        he rented a Mustang
convertible in L.A. and for several
        days I drove around
past the long rows of used car lots
        and the bruised facades of restaurants
digging up relatives, my hoarse-voiced
        arthritic aunt in the shadows of
her goldenrod colored ranch house,
        limping like Ruffian
after her last run
        in the wet dirt at Belmont Stakes.

                                                                 *

But I’ve said nothing about what made me weep.

It's in the contrast between Kitaj's alter cocker
seeking comfort on a train,
and Rembrandt’s taut youth
setting off into the rampant amber on horseback;
it’s in the image of active life juxtaposed
with the image of sedentary contemplation—
though no one travels on horseback now
and heroism has become
attending AIDS patients
or sheltering the homeless.
The raw youth’s feet are planted
lightly yet firmly in his stirrups.
His coat glows with many colors.

Not so The Jewish Rider.
And yet—there's something more.

                                                             *

Michael Hoffman writes that New York
is not what it was when I was too young
to have marked the existence of The Blue Note,
but I can pick up this trail
by walking across the park to the Frick.
And Barbara Hershey wouldn’t have been at the Frick in 1959
(they don’t allow children under sixteen)
in black skin tight pants, black sweater,
(the female uniform of our generation
whose male version substitutes
black jeans, baseball hat, and bomber jacket—
though who knows what decorous garments
she’d checked in the cloakroom),
and white boots with plenty
of Elizabethan ruff at the edges,
pausing to look at The Polish Rider
while I scribbled notes. Her white
boots stood out against the dominant dark
like the Jewish Rider’s white loafers.

And that was good because the light in the painting is brief
whatever the time of day, sunrise or sunset,
and the rider’s gaze, looking out over
unknown space, is inward.
I followed his eyes through the archway toward canvases
where clouds roll over harbors
against the whiteness of sails
or toward gilded robes and velvet-hung rooms,
then back to meet wisdom’s bared breast
in Veronese’s Wisdom and Strength...
(Why didn’t Veronese have the nerve
to call his painting Woman
With Bare Breasts, like Tintoretto?
Why an allegorical title when the bare
flesh and bones and sinew would have done?)
He spends his life looking not
at far off hills or citadels or
the lights in the village below:
he has no choice but to fix
on her one bared breast, her swelling nipple.
I can’t figure out what landscape
he might be facing in the painted world.
The clatter of rocks and hooves
echoes over the stony plain.

                                                                 *

I was no rider, but a pretend
horse and rider always rode
beside my train window—at a canter
no matter how fast the rails clicked by—
and though he wore a bandana
and leaned slightly forward in the saddle
to pull himself aboard,
his gaze, wide-ranging yet intent,
was like the Polish Rider’s.

Even as an only child I was never lonely.

My mother's father rode until he was old
and on a narrow pass his horse
jammed him up against rockface.
In his narrative of his life
this collision marked
the ruin of his hip
the rise of his cataracts.

My father rode “every morning before work.”

I never witnessed that,
but at a ranch in upper New York State
while I bloodied my hands
tugging the reins of a frothing giant
who would not budge from a weedpatch,
I watched him disappear
in his black polo shirt and khaki jodhpurs
as he galloped over a far off hill:
more at ease in the saddle—in the air—
than I’d ever seen him in civilian life.

My woman friend in El Paso lives to ride.

Only the Jewish Rider and I do not ride!

                                                                  *

That’s the stuff of events. What about
the signature inscribed by the sun,
the dark clouds sinister in just being there;
thresholds, exchanges going on in the village below,
candles lit in the deep interiors,
bread, wine, the plate making its way
around the table; what about—

leaping centuries ahead—
the energy from generators blazing
like auras through the clouds
the scattered lights,
the rotating tops of ambulances;
the tuna casseroles and macaroni and cheese

making the rounds, apple sauce
passing from high chair to bib, the Wonder Bread
on a calcified plate,
children eating, heads down, in silence,
communicating through eye movements,
the mother wiping her lips, the father
grinning stupidly and drooling;

the television quacking in the background,
the perfect suburban night unfolding
in bedroom and drive-in and den,
the sprinkler system ticking.
The snipers in the tower—.
This is what the riders,
guests everywhere and nowhere,

say goodbye to as their horses break into a canter
as night comes down. And last
night, driving to Connecticut,
I understood that the Polish Rider
gleans the permutations of light after dusk,
that its olive-gray smudges reflect
the absence of pitch-darkness. I was wrong

about the Polish Rider all along:
he doesn’t depart at nightfall, he stops for a moment
crossing difficult terrain (anticipating rockslide?)
in the night, because, as the faint light
rimming the edges of the sky makes clear,
night is not absolute black, but rough-hewn and curious.
The rider lives in order to depart.

                                 The Woman Who Rode

She hitched her horse to the gateposts of my house.
Bare trees, frost, the whole bit.

I wanted our lives to be like that:
as rife with silences as a Quaker meeting.

She came to me in her stride.
Dropped her crop on the chair.

Peeled off her britches and boots; crawled
under the covers.

Her hour in the saddle had “made her ready.”
I felt like an accessory.

The wound was open. Drowsily I rolled
onto her, no longer caring if she

was using me. As the new
year wore on and black ice made riding

a fast track to certain death
or paralysis, she grew tense.

Came to me now with clinical terms,
“schi” words I worked hard to break down.

The good news was she was not a true
“split personality”—the glitch

that “she was divorced
from herself, and could not love or care.”

                                                                  *

The light in her house
was like the light before dawn.

On the last of my rare visits
her mother jarred preserves while we watched

instant replays of Robert Kennedy die and die.
Her father skulked upstairs, perhaps

testing gadgets; or wishing me off his daughter;
or taking precautions I would not overhear

what words were ricocheting
on his “hot line” to the patent office.

                                                                 *

Any objective observer standing back
from the distraction of the impinging present

could see that her torment overleapt
any visible signs and that she was—

as a WASP “rider”—the wrong
person for the place she was in.

Her resilience could not be in question.
She lived to stray from known paths

to leap stone fences and break into open fields.
When her horse went down in an Irish bog

and she was trampled—hooves branding her cheek—
the next day she up and mounted him again.

                                                                *

When she came to me in the dream last night
her smile had loosened.

How lovely she looked in her blue silk blouse.
How well it lit up the colors of her hair.


title: poem for bruce
poem: Under the roof is the empty room
papered in requiem blue.

Partiers crowd the burned kitchen,
gold fixtures hook to cheap lath.

What is it they can tell you about absence
how it abates, takes names

Becomes a wall with windows
faced on a formal garden, content

To accept the thin rain. The syllable
forgives the words that need it, a sentence

Badly written, epigraphs scrawled
thoughtlessly in books. Book where the hero

confronts a dark riddle, book where
the suitors stand at the gate and are stumped.

What force brought them forward
stooping at the lintel, up the chipped steps

To the blue door in the unbuilt tower,
half-built, the new stone.


title: Carpet Bomb
poem: I can’t get rid of useful things
and nobody wants to pick them up,
I keep forgetting where I lay my umbrella.

I don’t leave footprints in the snow anymore,
we haven’t had a war on domestic soil in so long
I wonder if I still got it. Because once I had it.

I heard about a boy who once tied a string to his brother,
he tied his brother to the ocean and the ocean to the blackbird—

from the ground all the birds look like blackbirds
from the ground a Stealth Bomber looks like a spaceship.

The aliens are coming,
they walk through birthday parties
and basically go unnoticed.

And this is kind of how I go through life,
once I heated up a spoon in the microwave
the fish have so much mercury in them they spark.

I was handed a bayonet from the Civil War
and a copper penny corroded with rust.
When they take the Statue of Liberty apart to clean her
her neck explodes with a million little spiders.

Meanwhile in a forest somewhere
someone cut open my grandmother’s belly
and filled it with bricks

something is coming soon
I keep a bucket of lambs blood
by the front door.


title: Antarctica
poem: Like nights we knelt on the dirt floor
of a dugout, leaned our heads back,
eyes twitching gone, and popped nitrous
canisters into the communion shapes
of our mouths, slipped inside where
everything seemed to be falling snow,
ice, the time split between chasing flies
through a darkened park and sprawling
in sycamore bark—how clean that abyss
we drifted in, like dew, more like pollen,
on our skins; and, beneath, a want
for touch, a kiss, a return. Like nothing
back then, to break an arm latching on
to the bumper of an Impala, or settling back
as the car took us as far as the salted bridge,
before letting the ride go with a mitten
caught behind the chrome waving
from the other side of the river. Like this,
you said, sliding a needle, watching
dope plunge, the body's rush and tow
until you felt something like an angel
hovering above, but it was only pigeon
feathers deviling the air. Those friends
are gone: some dead, dying, locked up
or jailed in themselves; and when I see
some kids running in the heat of a taillight
swirling behind them, I remember we
wanted only to quiet our bodies, their
unnatural hum, a vague pull inward,
some thin furrows gliding over the snow.


title: Teenage Riot
poem: All of us were boys only some were taller or already in high school, and almost
      nothing else
mattered but to learn some new trick,
to pull off something we saw in a skate video, wind cutting
around our bodies when we flew
off the lip of a ramp, grabbed the board and twisted
into a 180, kicking
a leg out and landing it, the only way to run
through the neighborhood
was to run through it
together, flipping off cops and skinheads, I almost
don't even remember girls but a vague sense of the taste of bubble gum
and how they smelled so different
from us, sitting in some kid's basement drinking
his parents' vodka, we grew out our bangs, moved in a pack,
jumped in when some one of us
got jumped,
so when a man we had never seen before
came up and started beating on Simon, one of us dropped his skateboard, walked
over to the man
like someone walking into a bank
and stabbed him.
The man, startled, sat down, right there on the asphalt,
right in the middle of his new consciousness,
kind of looking around.


title: Minimum Wage
poem: My mother and I are on the front porch lighting each other's cigarettes
as if we were on a ten-minute break from our jobs
at being a mother and son, just ten minutes
to steal a moment of freedom before clocking back in, before
putting the aprons back on, the paper hats,
washing our hands twice and then standing
behind the counter again,
hoping for tips, hoping the customers
will be nice, will say some kind word, the cool
front yard before us and the dogs
in the backyard shitting on everything.
We are hunched over, two extras on the set of The Night of the Hunter.
I am pulling a second cigarette out of the pack, a swimmer
rising from a pool of other swimmers. Soon we will go back
inside and sit in the yellow kitchen and drink
the rest of the coffee
and what is coming to kill us will pour milk
into mine and sugar into hers.


title: W is for Walt Whitman's Soul
poem: One of the very first Indian words to enter the English language was the Hindustani slang for plunder: "loot."
WILLIAM DALRYMPLE

   It sits with a fork made from a lotus on an ivory chair eating an elephant steak in the company of bears and feral nautch girls on a monsoon evening incandescent with an appetite as mighty as railroads spann’d across seas and reclines, its cheeks burnished, its ass varnished by suns setting on bronze and sugared with saltpetre, its torso a tableaux for the annals of rectitude, the theatre for roiling or robust passage, a veritable Suez Canal towards missionary victories which thrust from such bejeweled and oiled loins anointed by coin— that emission of plump plums, lump sums into the Ganges, that coiling coy virgin maiden winding her languid locks, batting her lashes to its lashes— its spine a gentle wire. Supine, its belly swells with salt and figs with meat and treaties, it corks open a profound song— itself it sings into books heavy with truths on the chair dressed with leather and raw hides kissed by ox blood smeared with beef dung lined with raw silk woven from worms plucked from boughs basted across its pious beaming eyes its spidery ghosted lids, and its byzantine glance unmoors from its Chinese porcelain and crosses the ebony table polished with lac secreted from the cloaca of the kerria lacca set with glazed cakes eaten by pinked mouths wearing crimson robes, to its guests polished and glossed and stained by the ooze drawn to color the uncolored raw linen, the wood, the human. Then its wrist cuffed by gold and cowries and studded with coral draws a whisper- thin muslin veil dyed carmine— sucked from crushed scale of cochineal boiled in ammonia and bled into curds and rouge glinting sanguineous and turbid between bug and rug snug a thug in redcoat or a turncoat carrying urns of this stuff— from estates of cocoa coconut calico— across its face while soft éclairs of chocolate bumble out from its plumed rump choked with gum and linseed flax and cassia cinnamon and pepper like so many lines of blood underwriting the mutton and not the goat so it can sell them with a name of a place like scarves or garlanded whores moored to wharves suckled by mother of pearl or teas named after Earls and they with whole scores to settle settle for homemade cures nettles ginger turmeric— a paste or to taste—and it steals and seals in letters scented with sandal sent abroad waxed and pressed with cornelian gems honed from ground it owns and makes stone from their flesh ekes ink from their sweat soaks indigo in lye fermented with time and makes color so it can bid for its own passage, the passage, O of this soul, to India!


title: J is for Jarasandha
poem: There once lived a great king whose twin wives could bear him no children. A wandering sage saw the king’s grief and offered him a magical mango. She who ate the mango would be with child. As he had two wives, the king cut the mango into two perfect halves and offered one half to each wife. After nine months, each wife gave birth to one lifeless half. Horrified, the king ordered these clots of flesh to be left in the forest. A wandering demon found the two lifeless halves and cupped one in each palm. When she brought them together, the two halves fused and a whole child was made in front of her eyes—the demon named the child Jarasandha.

Years passed by and this child grew to be an intimidating and invincible warrior. In a fight with Bhim, an equally invincible warrior, Jarasandha was ripped in half by his enemy. But, each time he was ripped apart, his halves found a way to meet up and become whole. Krishna, who witnessed how Jarasandha’s flesh found its own way back to flesh, motioned to his own cousin with his fingers: toss the halves of his body in opposite directions, he

suggested.

So, when Bhim ripped Jarasandha apart once again, he swung his left half to the right side of the arena and his right half to the left. And his body found no way to return to itself.

In the Toronto airport, where I’ve arrived for a conference, I watch an older Punjabi lady—made to sit in a wheelchair behind two lines of customs officials, a security guard, a translator, and a service-staff member—scream that her son is outside the airport may she please just go tell him she is here she is here she is here please. I stand there holding her hand, my own luggage reluctantly traveling in loops on the belt. Beta—child— she says to me: please tell them my son is here and I am here what is the problem let me go let me go to him.


title: M is for Michael Jackson and Malcolm X
poem: In the epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Alex Haley recounts meeting a pensive Malcolm at the Kennedy airport, watching newly immigrated children “romping and playing” in their sudden home. “By tomorrow night,” Malcolm says to Alex, “they’ll know how to say their first English word—nigger.”
Before cable television arrived in India, America was a white nation. I imagined New England snows dusting California and Miami’s beaches stretched across Appalachia. America was a papier-mâché parody patched together by a cheaply hired prop maker. Geographic accuracy was sacrificed to the interpersonal dramas of Betty and Veronica, and the American banquet was limited to the malted and fried offerings in Pop’s Chock’lit Shoppe, where the Riverdale gang solved the real geopolitical problems of how to get Reggie off Moose’s back with the help of Archie’s fumbling charms. Here, class warfare came with a side of fries. There were rumors of distant family members “settling” in “North Dakota” or “Oklahoma”—names that put themselves together like Lego castles: hard-edged and jutting out with an abrupt L or a particularly pokey K.
Blackness was just a rumor too. Blackness flickered in the background of photographs they sent back from these mysterious locations: here’s an uncle waving at us from a glittering Times Square (Los Angeles); here’s an aunt waving at us mid-way through the soft-focus neon breakfasts with Aunt Jemima’s maple syrup (made from maple leaves); here’s a nephew waving at us next to the poster of a red and white Michael Jordan in a quilted bedroom, his rotund brown body snuggled in tie-dye and tucked into tartan flannel sheets. Blackness was a rumor, that is, until Michael Jackson’s Bad ripped into our consciousness and suddenly, knobby-kneed pre-teens found a way to make stringy curls with coconut oil stolen from their mothers’ kitchens and started moonwalking backwards into my Social Studies classrooms, all snappy crotch and jaunty limbs. We girls rolled our eyes but we kept on watching.
It wasn’t long before Jackson’s unsparing gaze, draped in slick black leather, began replacing the glowing pastel Ganeshes and Saraswatis hanging above study desks. But replacing an elephantine god’s soft paunch with lean, mean celebrity did not save us from our own ignorance of how blackness and brownness were connected through a struggle for economic self-realization and human rights. While kids in Chennai were rehearsing Michael Peters’ signature choreography for “Thriller” and pretending to be zombies—little exemplary half-dead spectacles—Union Carbide was industriously shirking responsibility for the Bhopal Tragedy, which choked thousands of Indians to death, and black mortality was spiking in violent, homicidal protest of the US DEA’s drug buys and cocaine busts.
In other words, Tamilians blinked away Michael Jackson’s blackness. We kept the heat and thunder of his fat synth bass, which found its way into Ilayaraaja’s electric disco in films of the late 1980s like Vetri Vizha and Agni Natchathiram. We kept the ebullient automation of his moves, which became a muscular theme in Prabhu Deva’s blend of baggy breakdance and whimsical terukoothu folk dancing in the 1990s. But we forgot his blackness. In time, the lightning of his presence was replaced by the grey hum of CNN, Cops, Law & Order, and the dull horror of handcuffs on dark wrists. Posters yellowed, cassettes spooled out, and my moonwalking classmates found their scientific calculators and study guides again.
But the rumors of racial difference in George Bush Sr.’s America continued to bloom and wilt in morose cycles in my childhood homes into the 1990s. In damp clusters, it grew like moss under rocks. Rootless, it stretched its stringy arms and held us by the ankles; it grew like mold between bathroom tiles; it spun itself fine and strong, webbing into corners where our brooms couldn’t reach. In time, the mossy rocks lined our after-dinner walks past the hibiscus bushes. In time, a grandmother slipped on the bathroom tiles and stayed in bed, fed conjee by a fatherless girl brought in from the village and the moss grew between her toes and drew her into the earth where they buried the nameless pets and tossed the chicken feathers. In time, the spiders hung so low they fell into pickle jars every time a child fished for a gooseberry or a slice of stony green mango from the brine. And from this brine, in time, we learned to believe that it existed. And as Tamilian families began drifting from the flashy monsoons of India to the June gloom of the California bay or to the sharp wet summers of the Keys, they carried the damp and stench in suitcases and buried it in hushed conversations. They made a poultice of moss and spider web and lodged it in the prayer books, hung it around the children’s necks like a talisman, and they said—as long as she doesn’t marry a black man.


title: How It Worked
poem: It was hard to sit there with my father,
watching one of my sister's girls playing
a set of tennis against my son or daughter
because he'd forget himself and with a groan
of disappointment or a grunt
of sympathetic exertion make it clear
that he was rooting for my sister's child
and against mine. There was no use
calling him on it, because he'd deny it
and get angry. So I would get angry
but try not to show it, until I couldn't
stand it any longer and would get up
and walk away. That was how it worked
between us, the unspoken building up
like thunderheads above the tennis court,
where the kids played on, not caring who won
and hardly noticing the sky had darkened.


title: In Memory of My Heavy Metal Years
poem: There goes the
aluminum, the antimony, the arsenic
the barium, the cadmium,
the cesium, the gadolinium
the lead
the mercury
the nickel, the thalium, and
the tin.
There goes that job spraying lawns
with chemicals, driving the Merc
three-quarter ton
with a tank on the back
and no brakes
through West Vancouver, bouncing
the wheels against the curb
to stop
and on the steep
majesterial streets
that afford such views
that they could hire
two talentless dickbrains
to weed and feed
front and back
and back again
in two weeks.
That was a heavy metal job
that probably killed
a lot of salmon too.
There goes the shotgun
pellets from the pheasants
we shot out in Abbotsford and Langley
plucked and hung
in the concrete basement
in New Westminster
fresh
with the stink of pheasant guts.
Oily, delicious pheasants
roasted always
with a little buckshot
after a day off.
There goes those summers painting
houses with my brother
wire-brushing off
the old paint, breathing
it in on the wooden ladders
white guys working
on a tan
and saving up for the Peugot
ten speed. There goes
the seventies
out from my body.
Led Zep Humble Pie Burning Spear, and
Marley too, adidas, big E Levis
from Lee's Men's Wear on Sixth Street
there goes that brown house
paint, broken down
and pissed out.
There goes those years
beachcombing along the Fraser
from New West to Lulu Island
pulling out cedar blocks
that had floated free
from the shake factory booms.
Pulling the blocks out
of that industrial muck
grey green and foamy
down near Scott Paper, the mill
that Larry worked in until
it moved
production south.
Then stacking and drying the blocks
to split them into shakes
with a birchwood
hammer and an adze. There goes
that industrial mix
from the Fraser
from the riverbank
from the bars by
