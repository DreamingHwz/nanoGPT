title: The Sonnet
poem: The passion so his life was for bread;
A nobler spot of bread was stained with wine,
She looked at the wooden tables;
She was sitting quietly for his smile;
Not yet the more awful sight
And the most beautiful was the more.
The gift of man was dead;
She knew not how weak the child was dead;
She lay upon the door,
And she gazed up in his room
And made an old man in bed.
The angels lay in tears
And the children stood still.
He stood upon the earth
And the children came to earth.
He saw the footsteps of his mother,
And the only man came from bed,
And the spirit of his mind
Were left him; and the one
That was not the one that was,
And the child that lived there.
He saw the trees
He saw the fire of the dead
And the tears was light, and the white eyes,
And the terrible deep
That made him of him for his time;
And the wound was deep, for the soul,
And the bright and gentle joy
Were growing in a dream:
But the morning came the day

We came in the evening of the night,
And the breath of the sea.


title: The Past
poem: The day on the road
And the evening through
Was listening to the house of the dead,
The day of the rain
With the little grey traffic on the beach
On the shadow of the snow.
The blue sky was looking at the wall
And the snow was waiting there.
The moon was warm like a warm wind.
The water had settled water in the wind
Was over the field.
I saw the sky was empty.
The white, and the moon was silent,
The house was cool enough to float over the ocean.
The snow was quiet, white in the trees.
The air was huge and high,
And the sun had burned out and the water
And the burning of the water.
I was sad.
The moon was asleep in the dark.
The moon was soft, and so it was cold,
And the stars were cold.
The trees were empty in the rain.
The clouds were empty.
The moon was yellow.
The moon was asleep and the rain was cold

because the sun is more
than when the sky is at all.


title: The Dream
poem: In the morning I was told you to be a boy who died in sleep
and the house was an old man who was waiting for a man
and the house was a father who walked away
on the road with the men and children
who cried to the boy who was the first child
and the daughter of the child who died to be the child of the child
and the father the mother of the wife of the men
and the wife of the brothers of the mother
mother of the mother of the mother of the daughter of the family
and she who the woman is a woman
a newborn one of the her father is
it is a small angel or God
it is the shadow of a woman
with the god of the man who wakes the
the house she opens the street and thinks he does
the small story of the child
the child has a house she will know?
The dog is dead in the yard
and the dog is asleep
and the woman is dying
and the man feels his shadow
and the man feels the man
and an instrument is in the house
and the man is awake for the house
and the body is his journey
and the man the man is asleep
the man is his story
and he is a wife in the house he is there
and the men are coming in the window
and the boy is walking down
and the one day
and the father is asleep and the other
When the child is in the bed and the brown men
who are happy now
and the man is in the house
and the man is the man who walks the door
and knocks the shadow of the woman in the house
and the man stands in the house and waits
with the one man in the door
and the people are asleep
and the men are about to be alone
and the men who cannot be happy
and the women are the people of the men
who walk along the grave facing the house
and they are beautiful who is the one
and the people who had to dance at the children
and the man is the boy who is coming in the house
and the people are in the house
and the men get tired of the house
and the men have come down to the man
being so many people are born in the earth
and


A second time, she opens her head.

As if after she had to stop spinning

into a little pool of  the land,

she had to eat the world of  them,

the two of them in her arms,

to put her, and,


title: The Present
poem: The black moon has its way

to me along

the smooth light of  light.

What would we do?

What do We do but do around

the house to step?

They are not there

In the future,

and the eyes,

they are not there.


title: Poem for My Father
poem: My father once died, as she played with me.

My father was born in the middle of the night.

I was born in the dream of the dog.

I was born in the day as the moon was born.

I was born.

I had seen his beakers and who returned to his time.

I had the poet who loved him to die.

We were young.

We are not dead.

We are too young.

We are more people.

We are too young.

We are the only ones we are;

The ones of the people.

We have little plans we have to get away from it.

We are only in the country with us.

We are in our minds, we own suffering.

We are in the people and people in the people with them.

We are all in our lives. We are like we, only of them. We are a strange savior. We are an agenda. We are not a monster. We take a body. We are a god. We have a child. We are a god. We are the only man. We are the creatures we are the animals. We are a mother. We are our daughter. We are the girl. We are not part of us. We are a girl who we are a boy. We are a grandmother. We are a wife. We are a daughter. We are the woman. We are the mother and we are not the woman. We are the knives. We are the children.

What is you here?
They are not your people,
all your questions,
and your name.
What can you say?
Their words feel like voices.
They say.
They say,
You are the same
and the same,
and the sad world.
They say,
and the sky,
and the star
is the very infinite.
Now they say,
I love you.


title: The Loved School
poem: The children
are walking in the rain,
looking for a house.
They’re walking,
moving like a stick—
the old ones
they are looking outside
on the floor.
We’re busy looking back,
we’re looking into sleep,
moving through the trees.
They’re looking at it.
What is the way they are here.
The room is empty
with light.
The house is empty,
and the white cat
is in the next,
the room is empty.
They do not know that what
you mean.
They say they’re dreaming,
the women in the yard.
They look like babies
and they are thinking they’re making them.
They call you the one of them,
they say that their fathers says,
the music you hear the night
and the moon.
Women cry out to the window,
and they cry in.
They sing the sun
and they cry for the rain.
They are asleep
like a mirror in the hallway,
and the moon is the moonlight
and the sky is the moon
They see the trees
are the ones
and the ones who be the ones
like the same children,
the way them go out to the city
and the people who love it.
They say good people.
They say anything.
They say,
But they know that they have to lie together
with them, and they say.
They are the same people, they also say,
and they are the one they say.
They are a person who sometimes will tell you
that they say that they are as women.
They say, they are to the world.
They want to go to the grave."
They say, their sons
and they say,
the new ones become a man or a woman
who comes to

on which the end of the day, and how

get the seat back to school.

When I sit on the beach

of the car.


title: At the Edge of the Body
poem: It isn't funny when I'm sleeping

that I'm floating in the snow

I'm too tired of the sun

what is happening now

I'm waiting for a little snow falls

I'm waiting for the first time

I'm waiting for the house

and I'm waiting for the topdoor

and I'm waiting for the other

which is totally empty time

I'm waiting for them

alone or waiting for them

when I'm not waiting

for them or they're waiting for them

to go for you to you

go into the wind

and I'm waiting for someone

but the next one has come to it

I'm waiting for me

I'm waiting

to be alone, and I'm waiting

to eat it all the time you're ready

and I'm waiting for me

I'm waiting to read the children

and the children are having trouble

and the dead are coming up

I'm waiting to be free

I am waiting for you

to shut it all over and around you

where you're turning out

I'm waiting for the door

on a leash's back and forward

to the door to the door for the

someone's work in the book

I'm waiting for you

I'm waiting for you

I'm waiting for the city

I've come from being the city

now to be a house with everybody

I'm waiting in this way

I'm dreaming of a young man

I'm waiting for the first time

I'm waiting for the company

I'm waiting for you

I'm waiting for me will you

I'm listening to you

I'm trying to get this time

I'm not there because you'm a little one

I'm ready to walk open into a pond

I'm still waiting

I'm ready to be my happy boy

I'm waiting for the other in the closet

I'm waiting to fall from me

I'm not aware I

Somewhat. I remember the future
Understands the window by the window,
This is what I mean, and what it feels
But I was wondering. I was,
You’re looking around, he is sleeping.
I look at what I mean.
And I love you, you can’t
Get up here to work in the house,
And I tell you what I mean.
You’re looking through the street
And I know what I mean.


title: The Bridge of the Ocean
poem: They are sitting on the beach—
Those who are looking over the sea—
They are growing in the day—
They are sitting on the beach—though they are in the sunlight—
They are pretty.
They are almost friendly—
They are so sad—
They are in the same place.
They are too sad—
They are very regular.
They are always so sad
And they are very nice
They are very sad—
They are not serious.
They are very tired—
They are very foul and regular—
They are not mad.
They are dead.


title: The Building of Shadows
poem: 1
I am thinking about the weather
Where I am thinking of the home
Where I am going to be.
I am afraid of you
I am afraid of you.
You are saying to me to me
About the night and I am
The woman in the hospital
That’s already in Paris
And all that I am afraid
And I am afraid of you going to die.
I have seen rain
Where I am afraid of myself
Are not my mother or mother?
I'm not afraid of your parents in my house
When I am not afraid of having
My own words are afraid of your own life."
I am not afraid of you
Who are the man in his bed
And the woman who says
That my father is coming
I am afraid of you
If I am not afraid of you
And I am not afraid of you?
The night is still as quiet as a moon
And the night and I am not afraid
You are waiting for you,
They are the only one who says when you are on they
Are there
Do you think of the man
I know that every time
I have seen that I

As the queenly sisters cut down
the floor, as a child
And the mother in two.
How to shave the seeds
and the child’s wife
when she’s grown.

* * *
When she’s hungry,
she tells me
how to look down
at the door,
the son’s touch
the reins
he touches her hands
like the wind,
a child’s tongue.
The child
has sunk the bed
and he has
the strength of God.
The child
has never been
a wall of darkness
like the eyes of the girl
who’s gone again.
The child,
she’s gone
and she’s gone
and her brother
and her son
And the mother’s mother
gives him there.

* *

He walks to sleep,
holding her hand;
wrapped in her arms
and placed her
a cup of tea.

*

Rurgling from the wall,
and he walks to the yard.
He listens with all the children
who love the women

and the child she asks if she has seen her
our mother’s breath
like a bird who lies
when she is alive.
*

*

To me,
they wake me.
To me,
the woman
who is awake
in the white room.

*

The wife
are walking.
And he appears
in the twilight.
She is always
hearing the man
with the lights.
He is far too.
He is he,
and his death
about him.
He is very sad.
He is talking
that he is.
He is ashamed
and he does.
She is afraid
of the night he is breathing.

*

The mother says,
a man with it.

*

The daughter says,
she says,
and the daughter says,
“He is always afraid.”
The mother says,
“He tells us.”
The children
is in order
and the mother says
she tells me too,
the mother says, to see that.

*
To me
she says,
she says.

*

Whose words are gone.

They’re not talking to do not want to do

Nor can they do this.

They’re getting ready yet.

They’re getting a bit of the day.

They’re not afraid I liked to try to do
I’d like to be happy.

They’re just talking about

That’s why I’m going to be okay.

The night is coming from.


title: Song of the Mud
poem: The giant beanfield’s
shanty in a white pond

that doesn’t keep it back?

One comes

at last.

I find the tiny table

as I walk

into a field to a small town

somewhere in my window

and the window

and the moon comes back

and the window slides down

on the green road

on the edge of the black

for the sake of a long time

for the yellow door

we haven’t seen

in order to fit my eyes

in the last time

when I step into the leaves

the windows of the road

when the windows are opening in the light


title: Prayer for the Dead
poem: At a beach that night

the man who entered me:

father, father, who was a boy

walking, standing at the table

with a football team, he was a boy

from a field and couldn’t remember.

He was dressed, sitting on a walk

to the movies.

I wanted to see him, he cried, “I’m sorry,”

“I’m sorry I’m sorry.”

I took the first note, “I’m sorry.”

I picked a small lot away,

“Oh, baby, now?” he said.

“My mother died,”

“No,” he said. “I don’t die. Why,”

“I’m just supposed to be

except the time we’re there.”
